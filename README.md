# ATTiny13-Driving-Serial-Interfaced-LED-Display

I developed this to try two interesting things:
1. Developing a board that can host a serially interfaced LED display module. I.e. providing the module with necessary power and data wiring, to the ATTiny13.
2. Developing a software driver for the serially interfaced LED display that can fit in the less than 1K bytes flash memory of the ATTiny13. This means the driver shall allow room in the flash memory for a test program or another application.
